# CSGO Aim Bot - Experimental Learning Project

## Description

This repository contains a CSGO aim bot I developed to understand how aim bots work. This project was created solely for experimental and educational purposes. I do not promote or endorse the use of hacks or cheats in any form of gameplay. My intention was to delve into the mechanics and algorithms behind aim bots, not to encourage their use in actual games.

## Disclaimer

**This project is for educational purposes only.** Using hacks or cheats in any game is against the terms of service and can result in permanent bans. Please use this repository responsibly and only as a learning resource.

## Note

This aim bot was designed for CSGO, but it cannot be used in the game now that CS2 has been released. The code and concepts here are for educational purposes and are not applicable to the latest version of the game.

## Features

- Aim bot functionality to automatically target opponents
- Customizable settings for aim sensitivity and smoothness
- Detailed comments and documentation to explain the code and logic
